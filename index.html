                <p> <strong>Bit about me</strong> <br><br>

                    I am a second-year Software Engineering student at <strong>Macquarie University</strong> with a strong foundation in <strong>Java</strong>, 
                    data structures.
                    I enjoy building efficient, practical solutions through coding and problem-solving, 
                    and I am continually developing my skills through projects, coursework, and personal learning. 
                    As an international student sailing from <strong>Mongolia</strong>, I bring adaptability, persistence, and a global perspective, 
                    with a clear goal of becoming a <strong>software engineer</strong> and contributing to impactful software projects.

                <p> <strong> Mp3player </strong> <br></br>

                    A MP3 player that lets users add and organize songs into a custom playlist.
                    Users can browse and load songs from their device, view them in a list, and play, pause, 
                    or delete tracks directly within the app — providing a clean, easy-to-use interface for 
                    managing personal music collections. The project is purely based on java, javaFX for GUI design.
